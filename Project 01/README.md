# Project 1 - Combinations by Brute Force  

Consider the combinations problem: given integers n > 0 and k >= 0, with n >= k, list all the ways to choose k things out of n (use n distinct symbols). Assume that order doesn’t matter, so it’s easiest to use words that have the letters in alphabetical order, like abc instead of acb.  

For example, with n = 4 and k = 2, the desired list is ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd  

Draw a tree of possibilities for the instance with n = 5 and k = 3.
