# Project 5 - Working with the Definitions  

This project is intended to give you some simple, concrete experience with the formal definitions of O, $\Omega$, and $\Theta$.  

Let *f(n) = n<sup>3</sup>*. For each of the functions *g* given below, formally prove, directly from the definition, that *g* $\in \Theta$(f). Each of your 6 separate proofs must clearly state *N* and *c* as in the definitions of O() and $\Omega$(), and must clearly explain the algebra or experimentation supporting your inequalities.  

a. *g(n) = 1000n<sup>3</sup>*  
b. *g(n) = n3 + 1000n<sup>2</sup>*  
c. *g(n) = n<sup>3</sup>âˆ’1000n<sup>2</sup>* (assume *n >= 1000* for this to be a legitimate function for our purposes)
