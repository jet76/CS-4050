# Project 16 - The Entire RSA Process  

Work out by hand/calculator and write up a careful example of the entire RSA process, including computing $n$ to publish, encrypting $a$, finding the secret $d$, and decrypting $c$, with $p = 137$, $q = 241$, $e = 53$, and $a = 12345$. You will be expected to do all of this (including efficient modular exponentiation and the extended Euclidean algorithm) by hand/calculator during the test, so do the exercise that way, using just an ordinary calculator.  

Note that various classes in the ```RSA``` folder implement all the parts of this process. So, with a little judicious copying and pasting into and out of email messages, we can communicate securely by email.
