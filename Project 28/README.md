# Project 28 - Smallest Difference Problem  


Consider this problem: given $n$ real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, find the pair $a_j$ and $a_k$ for which $|a_j - a_k|$ is the smallest.  

Design and describe (you don't have to actually program it, but you should write psuedo-code or something from which it would be trivial to implement it) the obvious algorithm for this problem based on the idea of computing the differences for all pairs and finding the smallest.  

What is the effciency category for this algorithm?  

Use the transform and conquer idea to design a more effcient algorithm (again, write it in psuedo-code but you don't have to actually program it).  

What is the effciency category for this algorithm?
