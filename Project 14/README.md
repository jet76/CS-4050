# Project 14 - Efficient Modular Exponentiation by Hand

Perform the efficient modular exponentiation algorithm using a calculator for $a = 29613$, $e = 8075$, working in $Z_{31861}$.  

The folder ```Code/RSA``` at the course web site contains a class ```ModExp``` that does this algorithm, but only use it to check your workâ€”you will be asked to do this computation on the test with just a calculator.
