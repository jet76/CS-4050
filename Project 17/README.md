# Project 17 - Breaking RSA  

Please don’t share your answer to this project with anyone else—remember that the more people who complete a project, the less I will weight it in the course grades.  

Suppose you intercept the message $1027795314451781443748475386257882516$ and you suspect it was encrypted using RSA with $n = 1029059010426758802790503300595323911$ and $e = 2287529$. Break the encryption and determine the original message.  

You might find some of the code in the ```Code/RSA``` folder helpful for this. You might also find that you need to use ```wolfram alpha``` to factor $n$ (on my machine this works in a reasonable time). Note that I have used the scheme shown in ```Encode/Decode``` to switch between integers and strings.  

Email me your results, including the decrypted plain-text message and details of how you got it.
